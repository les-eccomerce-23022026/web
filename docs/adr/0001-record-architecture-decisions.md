# 0001. Record Architecture Decisions

Date: 2026-03-24

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a way to record architectural decisions made during the development of the web module to ensure that the rationale behind these decisions is preserved for future reference and to clarify thinking within the team.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) as described by Michael Nygard. Each ADR will be a short Markdown file stored in `web/docs/adr` and numbered in a monotonic sequence.

## Consequences

- Architectural decisions will be documented and searchable.
- Future developers will understand the context of current design choices.
- There is a slight overhead in documentation, but it is outweighed by the long-term benefits of clarity and alignment.
